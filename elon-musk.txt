@spacecom they are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much r&d risk on dragon 2, that i feel very confident of 2018.
@zperrin99 uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (rp-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed
btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop tvc wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. better to wait a day.
@zybbby not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question
if this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause

tesla keeps temp below 40c/105f by automatically venting cabin & turning on ac when needed. can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
my favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
this is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to v7.

@mactechgenius v8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. awesome on every level. meeting w design team every day.
tesla customers are v smart & don't want media speaking on their behalf abt autopilot. recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%.
@heroineworshipe @boschglobal it can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything >= water density) detection
@mactechgenius improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. doesn't need to be so loud.
great rebuttal by a tesla owner to those calling for autopilot to be disabled. was written with zero input from us. https://t.co/kfg1ewkocz
@tyler_k_berg that is a very good point!
have to focus on tonight's @spacex launch. will post tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
btw, want to thank both bosch and mobileye for their help and support in making autopilot better. please direct all criticism at tesla.
promising call today with @boschglobal, maker of our radar sensor. looks like significant improvements possible via ota software update.

our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. a good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. am hopeful...
@ruthedick especially well
@pfierens logs were downloaded for nhtsa and ntsb. identical copies to all.
good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust
@collinalexbell yes

@swiftonsecurity tricky in 140 chars, but: 1b needed for min statistical sample size. more software mods and data may be needed beyond that.
blog on autopilot by @peterdiamandis https://t.co/lr5zuw3j9x
@bolayer @swiftonsecurity us is ~11 deaths per billion miles. ww is 17 deaths per billion. autopilot already much better than either so far.
@c4757p @swiftonsecurity unless we get there and find it isn't enough. just won't be before 1b.
@fantaaiex it is extensively tested in the lab and in the tesla test fleet. however, there is no substitute for real world experience.
@swiftonsecurity with less than 1b miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1b is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
@nicatrontg @swiftonsecurity thanks. point of calling it beta was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect.
@_craigr @fortunemagazine exactly
@wfederman @stegen @fortunemagazine that wasn't criticism, just clarification
@swiftonsecurity why?
@wfederman @stegen @fortunemagazine thought i was posting reuters. copied the wrong link.
@vicentes probably six months. will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in autopilot.
@stegen @fortunemagazine you're right, no point
@chirag use of word beta is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. it is not beta software in the standard sense.
misunderstanding of what beta means to tesla for autopilot: any system w less than 1b miles of real world driving

turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
@fucktyler thanks tyler
landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. maybe hardest impact to date. droneship still ok.
upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. probably get there end of year.
@astroorionmk @badastronomer quite rapid... yes
rud = rapid unscheduled disassembly :)
looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. high g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.

fast replay of today's rocket landing on spacex droneship ocisly
https://t.co/i0qq2d3bte
@dfjsteve very similar. the crush core in the falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. easy to replace (if falcon makes it back to port).
rocket landing speed was close to design max & used up contingency crush core, hence back & forth motion. prob ok, but some risk of tipping.
satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. all looks good.

falcon heavy thrust will be 5.1m lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. it's a beast...
f9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71m lbf later this year. it is capable of 1.9m lbf in flight.
@elonmusk f9 leo payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg
@lukealization no cross feed. it would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
@lukealization no physical changes to the engine. this thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. it is just tougher than we thought.
@elonmusk max performance numbers are for expendable launches. subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.

@gatorwass you can do that now with s and x. will be same for 3.
@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
@eduardoforneck hopefully 0.21
@peteehmkay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?
@tapwin no, but we will need to build a factory in europe to serve long-term regional demand as fremont reaches max capacity.
@mpatfield no problem
@crackedupcorson will cover whole country hopefully this year
@andersrytter yes, but production awd will be a lot faster
@alexbelohlavek less
@torvos torque is shifted between front & rear motors every ~.01 secs. traction control is way better than a normal awd. digital vs analog.
and, of course, it will have more cowbells.
model 3 will be rwd, with dual motor awd optional. even rwd will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of tesla drivetrain.
@golfshard yes
@zooropa88 @teslamotors superchargers and service centers will cover all of italy later this year
@_only_hawk @michaelsd01 @techgrltweeter definitely
@alandbru @teslamotors should be addressed this year
@cmaxvs only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. a bike will still fit no problem.
@ikrivetko that's not the real steering system
@b_rans yes. will easily fit two child seats. three if you buy slim seats.
@gerardomarina some tweaking underway
@hbl_cosmin wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. it feels like a spaceship.
@michaelsd01 @techgrltweeter won't happen. reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
@scottkelley99 edge and contour refinement are ongoing. even .1mm matters.
@_amwolo_ they can. will be great for road trips and camping
@bvalvsracing it will make sense after part 2 of the model 3 unveil
a model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
in general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
@ryancasburn we always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. loyalty begets loyalty.
@snoozethroughf1 there will be an optional tow hitch.

falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it? https://t.co/dpxsrqwal9
rt @spacex: first stage approaches center of landing droneship in pacific https://t.co/li3q6lnwvp
@stunt_penguin @layon_overwhale stage 1 would reach low earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.
@jimmyvosika actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
if speed at stage separation > ~6000 km/hr. with a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. just not physically possible to return to launch site
as mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. all about speed.
@mbhnyc steel collet
well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! won't be last rud, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. https://t.co/w007tccanj
@uncle_gus probably
however, that was not what prevented it being good. touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
definitely harder to land on a ship. similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating.

@anakinsge hopefully, mid to late next year. we are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time.
@gangsofgtown given high local demand, a gigafactory in india would probably make sense in the long term.
@abrax4s yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in mexico now. official launch in next several months.
@javashri auto import duties are prohibitively high. hoping for a special category for evs. most of our discussion was about batteries.
@roneijlander we just finished building a huge expansion in tilburg!
these are all things i've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here.
model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. a china factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. a factory in europe wd happen for same reason.
my comments in china weren't transcribed correctly. tesla will keep making cars & batteries in ca & nv as far into future as i can imagine.
@jessicatetreau important to set ac to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which tesla service can provide
@shanenickerson amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. would cost less and work better with a new car.
autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!
regulatory approvals received, so autopilot rolling out to all countries! (excluding japan, which is still under review)

@daniellockyer we could actually do that...maybe we should
planning a significant upgrade of the droneship for future missions to handle literally anything. maybe give it a merlin for good measure :)

final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.

upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.
grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.

@john_gardi using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign & more data. maybe flight 21.
grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for x-wing style control. each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.

the gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower & weighs 160 lbs
engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
abort was caused by oxygen in ground side tea-teb. upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. aiming for mon eve launch.
@williamshatner will do. probably at least a few days. depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.

if launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt

yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone.

would love to do a pickup truck. something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension & mega torque.
technically, i got rich from zip2 & paypal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into spacex, tesla & solarcity.
if consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. we should prob not have tax on basic foods & critical meds.
@ponder68 carbon produced by a @spacex rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. no, we should not be exempt.
net of gas savings, a tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. maybe less costly then it first seems.
yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. market will then achieve best solution.
trees are net consumers of co2, so technically we would pay them money :)
exactly. seems crazy to risk the co2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). much better to emphasize the latter.
@maxmberger the collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
me & other private money funded tesla for first 7 years, got ipo+ govt money for 3, now paid back. yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
@grayj_ there should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census.
weight of scientific evidence. taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. am against bans, except in extreme cases.
exactly. better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. let market decide.
perhaps. i am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good & disincent bad.

@danabrunetti well, you see, by making it go to 11, that makes it louder than loud :)
supercharger announcement pushed to next week. something else this week.
@bryanclarke physics + a broad range of engineering. worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history.
@vicorly yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the model s
@malkosh we do

@seanchin @raimisj over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. not sales constrained.
@annabananastand it can do hands free right now. being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add...
@enggirl mostly water or coffee at home. when i'm out, will have macallan neat or vodka with something.
@danielmarshal15 it can dig up almost anything.
@jasonpolstein yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. requires hardware unfortunately.

@westcoastbill thanks bill!
am a fan of larry, sergey & google in general, but self-driving cars comments to bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. no big announcement here
tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is model s, model x, then mass market third gen vehicle & truck
@rebel_sal exactly
creating an autopilot for cars at tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. still a few years from production.

@chriscowan_  chris is great. took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system.
am getting lots of questions about the big supercharger announcement. aiming to do that the week after next.
@stoneymonster yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. should help all owners.
tesla raises model s resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry http://t.co/l5loxtyp33
@yatpay side boosters fall short & center core goes too far + florida is heavily populated. landing permission tricky :)
@pataneous we can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but i feel confident about the value anyway.
@2552nsf yeah, that is super tricky. will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.
@rebel_sal yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. new financing is not perfect, but much better.
@alan_nestos the legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy
@darma_setia more likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of hell. clarkson doesn't understand technology.
@jsonberland we did a ton of testing until they could handle 4x legally required impact energy. extremely tough.
@bigballi high pressure helium. needs to be ultra light. all 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than model s.
f9r (pronounced f-niner) shows a little leg. design is a nested, telescoping piston w a frame. http://t.co/h49tss2cyl
@roulezelectric this is about getting a prior announcement right. not part 4 yet.
time to up the ante (and fix some mistakes). tesla announcement tomorrow.
@astrostephenson we're aiming for late 2015, but nasa needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. would do the same
